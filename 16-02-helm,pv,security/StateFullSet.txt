StatefulSet  which is a K8s Workload API object which is actually used to manage
statefull application.

Maintaine Stable Network: Pod is having unique name
Ordered Deployment and Scaling: pods starts in sequence based on defination
Persistent Storage: Each Pod retain its data even after rescheduled
Stable pod names: like myapp-0,myapp-1, myapp-2

When To Use StatefulSet?

--- Distributed Systems: Kafka, Zookeeper
--- Databases: MySQL, PostGreSQL, mongoDb

**** Example ****
Deploy MySQL Database using StatefulSet

1. Create Mysql.yml for creating Headless service
2. Create PVC (each Pod in StatefulSet will get their own PVC)-- mysql-pvc.yml
3. Create statefulset inside that we will create pods (no of replicas and volumes)

kubectl apply -f mysql.yml
kubectl apply -f mysql-pvc.yml
kubectl apply -f mysql-statefulset.yml
kubectl get statefulset
kubectl get pods (see the sequence and names of pods)
kubectl get pvc (check the name of volume)

The Above same procedure if you wnat to do using nginx 
then see the below mentioned doc:
