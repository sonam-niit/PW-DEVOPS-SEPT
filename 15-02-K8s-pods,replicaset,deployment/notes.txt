A Pod is a smallest unit in kubernetes which is deployable. Inside a pod 
we can run one or more containers.
Pods run containers, they can not auto restrart if they fails.

-- Replica Set 
it is specifying number of pod replicas which are running all the times
if any pod fails then it will recreate in replicaset

-- Deployment: provides all controller updates and all the rollback features.
If any pod fails or any container fails it can restart automatically.

** Creating Pod ** 
Create pod.yml file save it
to create pod run below command
>kubectl apply -f pod.yml
>kubectl get pods
>kubectl describe pod nginx

** Creating Replics Sets ************
Create replicaset.yml file. add the mentioned code
>kubectl apply -f replicaset.yml
>kubectl get replicaset
>kubectl get pods
        ----Scaling------
>kubectl scale replicaset my-replicaset --replicas=5
>kubectl get replicaset
>kubectl get pods
        --- Scale Down -----
>kubectl scale replicaset my-replicaset --replicas=2
you can edit the no of replicas in file as well and apply
or directly use --replicas and give no of replica to scale up or down

Replicaset also maintain no of pods based on the no of replicas
means if you manually delete the pod replicaset will recreate the another pod
to maintain the no of replicas.

>kubectl delete pod pod-name
>kubect get pods (you can see the newly created pod)
>kubectl delete replicaset my-replicaset

       ******** Deployment **********

Let's create file deployment.yml
>kubectl apply -f deployment.yml
>kubectl get deployment
>kubectl get nodes
>kubectl describe deployment nginx-deployment (see the image version)
    edit file with nginx version: 1.21 save it 
>kubectl apply -f deployment.yml
verify using describe command
>kubectl describe deployment nginx-deployment (see the image version)
Checking Rolling Status
>kubectl rollout status deployment nginx-deployment
>kubectl describe deployment nginx-deployment

Go back to the previous stable version
>kubectl rollout undo deployment nginx-deployment
>kubectl rollout status deployment nginx-deployment
>kubectl describe deployment nginx-deployment(see the status and version)
