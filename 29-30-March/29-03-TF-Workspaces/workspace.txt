What are the TF Workspaces?

its a feature of TF which actually allows us to manage
multiple environments (like dev, staging, prod) 
by using same cconfiguration.

While working with terraform it provided default workspace.
we can create extra Workspaces as per our requirements.

Why Optimization of Workspaces?
----------------------------------
when we are working with multiple environments or multiple projects 
it provided benefits in 
    isolating state: manage state specific for diffrent diffrent environments
    simplify configuration: use common configuration for allows
    reduces Human Error

To work with workspace let's take one example
----------------------------------------------
created one folder named project1
    terraform.tf 
    main.tf
    outputs.tf

In your terminal execute 
terraform init
terraform workspace new dev
terraform workspace new prod
terraform workspace list

change workspace: 
    terraform workspace select dev
    terraform apply -auto-approve
    terraform workspace select prod
    terraform apply -auto-approve

Destroy command
    terraform workspace select dev
    terraform destroy -auto-approve
    terraform workspace select prod
    terraform destroy -auto-approve

---------------------------------------------------
work with multiple workspaces as well as env files

project:
    env 
        dev.tfvars
        staging.tfvars
        prod.tfvars
    main.tf
    outputs.tf
    variables.tf
    terraform.tf

-- terraform workspace new dev
-- terraform workspace new staging
-- terraform workspace new prod

terraform workspace select dev
terraform apply -var-file=env/dev.tfvars -var-file=regions/us-east-1.tfvars

terraform destroy -var-file=env/dev.tfvars -var-file=regions/us-east-1.tfvars

delete workspace
    terraform workspace delete dev
