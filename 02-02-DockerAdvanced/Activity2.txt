Bind mounts for File Sharing
Share file between the host and the container

Created a folder host_diretory in C: drive
create index.html file and add some content

Now we want to mount this to our container

docker run -d -it --name devtest -v C:/host_directory:/usr/share/nginx/html -p 8080:80 nginx

Once its deployed check localhost:8080 you can see the content Mounted.
