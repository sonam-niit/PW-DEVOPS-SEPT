Start Docker Desktop
Check kubernetes is enabled or not.

Install Minikube
check Minikube version
>minikube version

Start Local Cluster
>minikube start (once the cluster started check node status)
>kubectl get nodes (here you can see one master node which is minikube)

To get CLuster Info:
>kubectl cluster-info
For more details
>kubectl cluster-info dump

Pod and Containers
--------------------------------------------------
Container is a lightwight, standalone executable package which includes our application and
packages.

Pod is smalled unit in kubernetes which can container one or more tightly coupled Containers.
-- Acts as a wrapper around multiple containers which can share same network and storage volumes.
-- Each Pod has a single IP address and all container inside that pod can share it.
Containers can communicate with each other using localhost.
-- If you want to group multiple containers which can work closely together you can use POD
-- kubernetes schedules and manages pods including resource allocation and replication.

Create my-pod.yml file as shown here
>kubectl apply -f my-pod.yml
>kubectl get pods
(you can execute twice to see the updated status)
>kubectl describe pod nginx (check the events)

Now to expose the pod as service cretae my-service.yml as mentioned

>kubectl apply -f my-service.yml
>kubect get svc
>kubectl describe service my-service

To access that in browser you need to execute 
>minikube service my-service 
automatically redirect you in browser.

(if you want to delete pod or service use below command)
>kubectl delete pod pod-name
>kubectl delete service service-name

Deployments:
If you want to manage set of pods and replicas then we can take the help of Deployments

Let's Create One Deployments
go to the official documentation: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/

Cretae one deployment1.yml file add the sample deployment code.

>kubectl apply -f deployment1.yml
>kubectl get deployment (you can see 3 services available)
>kubectl get pods (you can 3 pods)
>kubectl get rs (set of replicas)
>kubectl get pods --show-labels (Pod with labels)
