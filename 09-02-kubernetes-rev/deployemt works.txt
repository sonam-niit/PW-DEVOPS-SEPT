We have created a deployment means actually its creating some set of replicas.

We exposed only one service for deployment
how it is going to use all replicas?

Service acs as load balancer which is actually distributing traffic among all the pod replicas.

-- Service select all the pods which matched with the label (app:nginx)

-- kubernetes uses endpoints to map the service with POD ips

-- when user sends a request, it hits the  service, automaticallt load-balancer balances the 
traffic across the all available pods

kubectl get endpoints deployment-service

kubectl get pods -o wide (see pods with Ips)
