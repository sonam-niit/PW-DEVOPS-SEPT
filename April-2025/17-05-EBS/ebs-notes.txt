EBS: Elastic Block Store

its a block-level storage volumes which we can use with EC2 instance.

Its a Persistent storage: we can retain data even after deleting instance.

gp3 (general purpose SSD) :: Latest General SSD, cost-effective
    use case: Boot volumes, workloads dev/test

gp2 (general purpose SSD) :: Older SSD :: 
    use case: Boot volumes, low-latency apps

iO1/iO2 (Provisioned IOPS SSD) :: High Performance SSD
    use cases: databases

Thoughtput optimized HDD (st1) :: high throughput, low cost
    use cases: Big data, data warehouses

sc1 (Cold HDD) :: lowest cost, infrequent access
    use cases: Archive, backups

Create Instance with simple flow
once the instance is launched check the zone

How to create EBS and how to use it to a perticular instance.
--> EBS --> Create Volumes -->
Give size 10GB --> tags add Name and value and save

If you want to attach volume to instance then instance zone and volume zone must 
be same. You can't the zone of a vloume once it is created.

for attachment: go to the list of volumens, select ext volumes --: actions --> attach volumes
select instance --> give the name  you can see the success of volumne attached

to verify check instance --> storage and see the attached volume.

Open wsl and try to connect with instance using ssh

then run below command: lsblk (check the disk space):
    xvda is default
    xvdf is externally attached volume

I wnat to check is my volume is having some data?
> sudo file -s /dev/xvdf
/dev/xvdf: data (indicates its empty)

Format it using ext4 file system
> sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdf

let's mount a directory to your volume
create folder: sudo mkdir /data
mount: sudo mount /dev/xvdf /data/
check for munting done or not: lsblk 

verify: df -h (mounting verify)

=====================================================================

cd /data
sudo echo "Hello From EBS" >  hello.txt (option 1)
echo "Hello From EBS" | sudo tee hello.txt  (option 2)
cat hello.txt

let's terminate instance and then 
verify by creating another instance 
attach the volume connect to instance using ssh
to access: mkdir /data
sudo mount /dev/xvdf /data/
cd /data (access your Persistent content)
--------------------------------------------------------------

When you create this /data mounting point its temporary (means if you reboot/ restart/ 
stop and start you instance then again you have to mount)

if your instance reboot then that mount point will removed means 
if you want to access again create /data directory then mount and then access

Now how to make it Persistent??
sudo blkid
(take the id for /dev/xvdf)

sudo nano /etc/fstab

UUID=de4899b8-e4b0-4c28-9fd4-9bcc96b854ef /data ext4 defaults,nofail 0 2
(add this at the end of the file)

save now you can try to reboot and then again connect and check
then also you can see the /data is mounted 

you can check by using lsblk or df -h command

if you terminate your instance means that point of mount also will get removed.
