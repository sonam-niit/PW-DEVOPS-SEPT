Monitoring is very important to detect the problems
    high CPU
    memory usage
    failed deployment

using that you can make your system more reliable, better performane and
continous improvements.

Fast Response:
    set alerts and logs
    check performane related issues.

Monitoring Tools:
--------------------------

Prometheus?
    -- it is open source Monitoring and alerting toolkit.
    -- it is very ideal to record real time mentics in time series db
    built in query language called PromoQL

Let's Set Up Prometheus:

Download: https://prometheus.io/download/
(download linux tar extract)

open wsl --> go to downloads folder --> just run ./prometheus

run you can see the default output on dashboard
http://localhost:9090/query

Now If you want to monitor your ec2 instance, then cretae one instance, with basic req. 
open 80,22,9100 inbound rule 

install node exported.
https://prometheus.io/docs/guides/node-exporter/

once installation start node exported and check the metrics
<public-ip>:9100/metrics

if running then edit local yml file of prometheus and then get the metrices from node-exporter

# my global config
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: "local"
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["localhost:9090"]

  - job_name: "ec2-node"
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["52.23.162.62:9100"]

Restrat prometheus:  ./prometheus --config.file=prometheus.yml

check it: http://localhost:9090/targets (here)

Execute your queries here:

http://localhost:9090/query

up --> run
node_cpu_seconds_total
node_network_receive_bytes_total
node_filesystem_size_bytes
node_memory_MemAvailable_bytes

execute them check the response and output in graph

For doing Real time Monitoring
----------------------------------------

CPU Usage: rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode="user"}[1m])
(showing per CPU user mode usage)

Memory Usage:
    check used memory
    node_memory_MemTotal_bytes - node_memory_MemAvailable_bytes

Disk Usage:
    node_filesystem_avail_bytes{mountpoint="/"}

Load Average:
    node_load1


Setup an alerts
create alert.rules.yml
--------------------------------
groups:
- name: example
  labels:
    team: myteam
  rules:
  - alert: HighCPUUsage
    expr: rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode="user"}[1m]) > 0.5
    for: 1m
    labels:
      severity: warning
    annotations:
      summary: "Instance {{$labels.instance}} has high CPU Usage"


update your prometheus.yml file
--------------------------------------------
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s 

scrape_configs:

  - job_name: "ec2-node"
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["52.23.162.62:9100"]
    rule_files:
      - "alert.rules.yml"

Restart it again and check.
